# General information

We may  *attempt* to live stream, the live in-person sessions.  Please note that it is UCL's expectation that students attend in-person.  The Zoom link is available [here](https://ucl.zoom.us/my/terrysoo).  Not all sessions will be recorded or streamed.  The recording links will be available on [Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=54044&section=0)---scroll to the bottom.
