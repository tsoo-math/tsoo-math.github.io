In this worksheet, we will consider the output of a Markov chain that is stored on a textfile.  We will import this data, and do basics statistics to estimate the stationary distribution of corresponding Markov chain.




*  Suppose you are given the output of a $100000$ steps of a irreducible and aperiodic finite state Markov chain.    Carefully explain how you could estimate the stationary distribution for this Markov chain, and why you estimator is reasonable.  

*  Import the data from the file [markovchain.txt](https://tsoo-math.github.io/ucl3/markovchain.txt)  and use this data and your method above to estimate the stationary distribution.

*  Any ideas for the transition matrix?
