[Recall](https://tsoo-math.github.io/ucl3/week8-2022-inclass.html) we learned a bit about symbolic computing using in Python.  In this worksheet, we will solve an exercise regarding return times and Markov chains, using Python (or brute force) and also using theory. 


# A Markov chain

Consider the three state Markov chain on $\{1,2,3\}$ where 
$$p_{11} = p = 1-p_{12}$$ 
$$p_{22} = q=1- p_{23}$$
and
$$p_{31}=1.$$

We will consider the case where $q \in (0,1)$ is fixed, but will think of $p \to 1$.  

* Write down the transition matrix.

* Suppose the Markov chain $X$ with these transition probabilities starts in state $1$.  Let $T = \inf\{n \geq 1: X_n = 1\}$.   Compute (by brute force) $\mathbb{E}(T)$.

* Find the stationary distribution of the transition matrix.

*  Simulate the chain, and leave $p$ and $q$ as variables that you can choose.

*  See that all your findings and answers are consistent.
