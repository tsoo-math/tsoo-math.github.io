Let $X=(X_i)_{i=1}^{\infty}$ be an iid sequence of random variables.  Let $N$ be a random nonnegative integer that is independent of $X$.  Suppose $X_1$ and $N$ have finite expectations. Prove that
$$ \mathbb{E} \big( \sum_{i=1} ^N X_i \big)  = \mathbb{E}N \mathbb{E} X_1$$


# Tiling

*  How would you do [Exercise 4](https://tsoo-math.github.io/ucl/QHW6.1-sols.html) analytically? 

*  What would you do if there is more than two tiles, and the tiles did not occur with equal probability?

* Use simulations to test your formula.  


# Size-biased intervals

Let $\Pi$ be a Poisson point process on $[0, \infty)$.  Pick a (large)  number, say $x=\sqrt{2} + 100$.    Find the smallest interval $(A,B)$ such that $x \in (A,B)$, and $A$ and $B$ are points of $\Pi$, thus $B$ is the next arrival after $A$.       

*  Find the distribution of $S=B - A$.   

*  Is $S$ exponentially distributed?  Explain.

*  Do simulations to confirm your findings.
