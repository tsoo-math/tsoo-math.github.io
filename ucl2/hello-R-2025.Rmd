# Introduction

Welcome!  I would like to get to you a bit. But first

* Download/Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* Download/Install [R studio](https://rstudio.com/)
* Download/Install [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
* Install  [R bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html)
  * It is probably not necessary to install Bookdown and things are probably moving towards [Quarto](https://tsoo-math.github.io/ucl3/quarto.html).
* Install [Tinytex](https://yihui.org/tinytex/)

* It maybe possible to do everything for free or a small price over the [cloud](https://posit.cloud/)

Not only can you type run R code, you can produce html and pdf files with math and R code together!  Roughly speaking R studio is an easy way to use R, and R markdown is a language easily generates html files with R code and math symbols, allowing the use of basic [Latex](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) code; it is how I generates many of the html pages for our module.
