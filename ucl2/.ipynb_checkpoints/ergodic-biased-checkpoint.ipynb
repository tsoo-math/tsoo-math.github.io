    "Let $X=(X_i)_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ and $Y = (Y_i)_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}$.  Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are independent sequences; furthermore, suppose that $X$ is an i.i.d. sequence of random variables, and that $Y$ is an i.i.d. sequence of random variables.    Let $C$ be a single Bernoulli random variable with parameter $p \\in (0,1)$, that is also independent of $(X,Y)$.  Consider the sequence of random variables $Z$ given by setting $Z_i =X_i$ if $C=1$ and $Z_i = Y_i$ if $C=0$.  \n",
