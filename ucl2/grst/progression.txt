You must `enter' the exam via Portico about four months before you are ready to submit.

``Your supervisor is responsible for arranging the appointment of your examiners. This should be done at the same time as you complete your examination entry form, four months before you are due to submit your thesis. Examiners are appointed by UCL for their professional services as examiners with expert subject knowledge. A minimum of two examiners, one from outside UCL and (normally) one from UCL are appointed to co-examine all research degree candidates."  

A form needs to be filled out.  Please verify that the internal and external examiners meet the guidelines; in particular, there are limits on how many times one can serve as an internal or external examiner.  Please let me know that you have verified that they meet the criteria.  In addition, please let me know of any potential conflicts.
