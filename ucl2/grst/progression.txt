You must `enter' the exam via Portico about four months before you are ready to submit.

``Your supervisor is responsible for arranging the appointment of your examiners. This should be done at the same time as you complete your examination entry form, four months before you are due to submit your thesis. Examiners are appointed by UCL for their professional services as examiners with expert subject knowledge. A minimum of two examiners, one from outside UCL and (normally) one from UCL are appointed to co-examine all research degree candidates."  

A form needs to be filled out.  Please verify that the internal and external examiners meet the guidelines; in particular, there are limits on how many times one can serve as an internal or external examiner.  Please let me know that you have verified that they meet the criteria; I will require written confirmation from both the internal and external examiners before I submit the form to faculty.  The faculty will do checks and any errors will result in delays.   In addition, please let me know of any potential conflicts.

Interruption of study

There are various `standardâ€™ reasons for interrupting studies, for example, medical or taking up an internship.   There are also various consequences that one should carefully consider, such as possible loss of funding or visa status.  

Please see the information and links in the attached form:

https://tsoo-math.github.io/ucl2/grst/interruption-of-study-research-students.docx

In particular:

``2.7 Interruption of Study 1. Interruption of study may be granted on the authorisation of the Director of Student Administration, on behalf of the Research Degrees Committee, provided that a statement of support from the Principal Supervisor and/or Head of Department/Division is received. If approved, the period of interruption of study granted will be initially not more than one calendar year and any further period of interruption of study will be considered one year at a time. UCL may, at its discretion, grant an interruption of study to a student on grounds of illness or other adequate reasons. The need to take up or pursue employment during the programme will not normally be considered grounds for interruption of studies. 2. Interruption of study for a period in excess of two calendar years may be granted by the Chair of the Research Degrees Committee subject to the following conditions: i) The period requested will be considered on an annual basis and will not exceed five calendar years from the date when the period of interruption starts; ii) The date when the submission of the thesis falls due following resumption of study falls within ten years of the date of original registration; iii) Written assurances that the research will still be valid are provided by the supervisor and/or the Head of Department, with supporting documentation. 3. The Students website provides further detail on the Interruption of Study Procedure."
