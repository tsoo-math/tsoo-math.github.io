Information about visiting students

This short note is aimed at members of staff who may be interested in hosting visiting students

Formal route

If you are planning on hosting a visiting student for 3 months or longer, then they will need to be officially registered, and in particular, fees will apply:

In the fee-paying case, many of the regular rules then kick-in:

Informal route

If you are planning on ``informally'' hosting a student, then there may still be various visa requirements; my guess is these requirements would be similar to that of any other unpaid visiting scholar.  As long as they are not registered as a student and getting UCL credit, then they would most likely not require a student visa.  You may find this site useful:

With regards to informally hosting a student, the duty of care lies completely with the hosting advisor. 

The student will need access to the building and id etc; Shanna maybe able to help you with this.  Chakkapas maybe able to help with IT issues; the student may need to bring own laptop.  

It may be possible that the student be given office/desk space, like what is provided for our own research studentsl; there is currently a shortage.  Please give Marina lots of time to arrange this possibility.

As the department is quite quiet these days, the host should be available to receive the student when they arrive.
