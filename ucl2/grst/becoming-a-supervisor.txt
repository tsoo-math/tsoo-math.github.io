You may be exempt from the second course if you have previous experience.

The form requires approval from a departmental graduate tutor, and is sent the faculty for approval from the faculty tutor for MAPS.

There are various rules governing who can be a supervisor.

If you are a new member of staff, with no supervision experience, it may be necessary to include an experienced member of staff as part of the supervision team.

Other notes

- It is very likely that a potential student will need to be interviewed, and as a potential advisor you will be part of the interview and thus may be required to complete UCL recruitment training such as ``Fair and Inclusive Recruitment at UCL," in addition to the UCL mandatory training:

- It is very likely that if this is your first time supervising a student, and student you are interested in supervising has not yet been admitted, then Alex will be your main point of contact as the admissions tutor. 

- If the student is already admitted, and you are interested in being apart of their advisory team, then Terry will be your main point of contact.

- Typically, approval for UCL academic members of staff is straightforward.

- An honourary appointment may be required for people who are not affliated with UCL.

- Not all research fellows can be approved to be on a supervisory team; it may depend on grade, and term of appointment.

- Members of staff, who are on the teaching track, who are interested in supervising research students need special permission; in particular, an endorsement from the head of department.
