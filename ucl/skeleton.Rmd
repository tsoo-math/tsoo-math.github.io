# Abstract

These are a subset of the links that are available on the main Moodle page for our module.   This is *not* meant to be a replacement for Moodle, but may be useful if you are having trouble accessing Moodle.   In addition, most of html files were generated in R Markdown, and if you are interested in the source file, you can probably access it by changing the extension to *Rmd*.
