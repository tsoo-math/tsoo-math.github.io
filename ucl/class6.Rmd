#  Exercises on sampling

```{exercise, name="A disc"}
Let $U$ be uniformly on a disc of radius $\ell$ centered at the origin.  Express in polar coordinates $U = (R, \theta)$.  Show that the distribution of $R$ is not uniform.
```

```{exercise, name="Uniform random variable on a sphere"}
Discuss how you would generate a random variable that is uniformly distributed on the sphere.  Can you code it.
```


# Exercises on coupling

```{exercise, name="Positive correlations"}
  	Let $X$ be a real-valued random variable, and $f$ and $g$ be increasing functions.  Show that 
  	$$\mathrm{cov}(f(X), g(X)) \geq 0,$$
  	by computing   $\mathrm{cov}(f(X)-f(Y), g(X)-g(Y))$, where $Y$ is independent of $X$ and has the same law as $X$.
```

```{exercise, name="Maximal coupling"}  
Let $X$ and $Y$ be discrete random variables with probability mass functions given by $p$ and $q$, respectively.  Show that there exists a coupling of $X$ and $Y$ given by $(X', Y')$ such that the coupling inequality is obtained:
$$ d_{TV}(X,Y) = d_{TV}(X', Y') = 2 \mathbb{P}(X' \not = Y').$$ Hint: you want to specify a suitable joint distribution $r$.   Let $s_i = \min\{p_i, q_i\}$.     Take $\theta:= \sum_i s_i$.  Set $r_{i,i} = s_i$;  if $\theta \not =1$, *spread any remaining around*, by requiring that  for $i \not = j$, we set 
$$ r_{i,j} = \frac{1}{1- \theta}(p_i-s_i)(q_j - s_j).$$
```

*  Check that $r$ is indeed a suitable joint distribution.  
*  Check that if $X'$ and $Y'$ have $r$ as its joint distribution, then the coupling inequality is obtained.
