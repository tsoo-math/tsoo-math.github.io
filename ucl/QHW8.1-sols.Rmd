```{exercise} 
Let $X$  be an irreducible  aperiodic Markov chain on a finite number of states, started at the state $s$.  Show without using any fancy limit theorems, that $\mathbb{E} T < \infty$, where 

$$T = \inf\{ n \geq 1:  X_n =s\}.$$
  
```


<hr>

```{solution}
We go back to basics.  If $P$ is the transition matrix, then by the assumptions of irreducibility and aperiodicity, we know that $P^M$ has all positive entries for some $M>0$; let $\delta >0$ be the smallest entry.  Hence every $M$ steps, we have a non-zero probability $\delta >0$ of getting to the state $s$.  Thus 
$$ \mathbb{P}(T > kM) \leq (1- \delta)^k$$
  from which we easily deduce that $T$ has finite expectation.

```{exercise}
Let $N$ be a Poisson process on $[0, \infty)$.  Fix $T >0$.  Show that $R(t) = N(T-t)$ is a Poisson process on $[0, T]$.   Hint:  appeal to appropriate construction of Poisson processes.

```



```{solution}
We use the construction of Poisson processes are uniform random variables.  Suppose we are dealing with a Poisson process of intensity $\lambda$.    Specifically, we  divide $[0, \infty)$ into intervals of length $T$, where we independently place a Poisson number, with mean $T \lambda$, of independent random variables that are uniformly distributed in the interval of length $T$.   There is no real notation of direction in this construction; moreover if $U$ is uniformly distributed in $[0, T]$, then $T-U$ is still uniformly distributed in $[0,T]$.  Thus the desired reversibility is obvious.

```{exercise}
**By brute force**, show that for a $M(\lambda)/M(\mu)/1$ queue that is started with at stationarity, so that the number of items in the system at time any time $t$ has distribution

$$\mathbb{P}(Q(t) = n) = \rho^n(1-\rho)$$
  
  has the property that an arrival waits time $W$ until being served, where $W$ has law

$$ \mathbb{P}(W \leq x) = 1- \rho e^{-x(\mu - \lambda)}.$$

```

<br>


```{solution}
An arrival arrives at time $t$ to a queue with $n$ items in front with probability   $\rho^n(1-\rho)$, will have to wait for these $n$ items to clear, taking time which  is a sum of exponentials, giving a gamma distribution.  

We have for $x \geq 0$, that 

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbb{P}(W \leq x) &=& 1-\rho +  \sum_{n=1} ^{\infty} \mathbb{P}(W \leq x | N(t)= n) \mathbb{P}(N(t) =n) \\
&=&  1-\rho +   \sum_{n=0} ^{\infty}  \int_0 ^x \Big( \frac{\mu^n t^{n-1} }{\Gamma(n)} e^{-\mu t} dt \Big)  \rho^n(1-\rho)   \\
&=&   1-\rho +    (1- \rho)\int_0 ^x  e^{-\mu t}   \sum_{n=1} ^{\infty}  \frac{\lambda^n t^{n-1}  }{(n-1)!} dt \\
&=&  1-\rho +    (1-\rho) \int_0 ^x   \lambda e^{-\mu t}  \sum_{n=0} ^{\infty}  \frac{ (\lambda t)^n  }{n!} dt \\
&=&    1-\rho +  (1-\rho) \int_0 ^x   \lambda e^{-\mu t}  e^{\lambda t}  dt  \\
&=&  1-\rho +  \rho (1- e^{-(\mu - \lambda)x}  )  \\
&=&  1- \rho e^{-x(\mu - x)}
\end{eqnarray*}
```

```{exercise}
We say that a continuous-time Markov chain with generator-(Q matrix) $G$ is **reversible** with respect to the probability measure $\pi$ if

$$ \pi_i g_{ij} = \pi_j g_{ji}$$ 

for all states $i,j$.


*  Show that $\pi$ must be stationary.

*  Show the the continuous-time Markov chain corresponding to a $M(\lambda)/M(\mu)/1$ queue is reversible with respect to its stationary distribution.
```

```{solution}


*  We recall that the rows of a $Q$ matrix are cooked up to sum to zero.  Hence, 
$$(\pi G)_k =  \sum_i \pi_i g_{ik} = \pi_k\sum_i  g_{ki} = \pi_k \cdot 0 = 0$$ 
  
  
*    We recall that 
$$\pi_i = \rho^i(1-\rho)$$
  $$ g(n, n+1) = \lambda  \text{ and }  g(n, n-1) = \mu  \text{  for } n \geq 1$$
  $$ g(0, 1)= \lambda.$$
  
Hence we easily verify that for $n \geq 1$, we have

$$ \pi_n g(n,n+1) =  \rho^n(1-\rho) \lambda$$
  and
$$ \pi_{n+1} g(n+1,n ) =  \rho^{n+1}(1-\rho) \mu.$$
  Thus recalling that $\rho = \lambda/\mu$, we obtain the equality
$$ \pi_n g(n, n+1 ) = \pi_{n+1} g(n+1, n).$$
  Similarly, 
$$ \pi_n g(n, n-1 ) = \pi_{n-1} g(n-1, n).$$
For the case $n=0$, we have

$$\pi_0g(0,1) = (1- \rho)\lambda$$
  and
$$ \pi_1g(1,0) = (1- \rho)\rho \mu$$
so that
$$ \pi_0 g(0,1) = \pi_1 g(1,0).$$

Thus we have verified the reversibility conditions.
