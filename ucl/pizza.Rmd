# Random variables on a disc

Let $U$ be uniformly on a disc of radius $\ell$ centered at the origin.  Express in polar coordinates $U = (R, \theta)$.  To compute the distribution of  $R$, observe that

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbb{P}(R \leq r) &=& \frac{\pi r^2}{\pi \ell^r} \\
&=& (r/\ell)^2
\end{eqnarray*}
$$

In particular, we see that $R$ is *not*  uniformly distributed.  Specifically,  

$$ \mathbb{P}(R > \ell/2) = 1 - (1/2)^2 = 3/4,$$

so we see that $3/4$ is the *area* is accounted for by the region of the disc where the radius exceeds a $1/2$.
