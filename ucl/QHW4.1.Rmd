# Abstract

The purpose of this exercise is as follows.

* To see if you can use R markdown.
* To work out any kinks with regards to on-line Moodle submission.

Thus  in submitting answers to this homework, submit both the final generated html file and the Rmd source.


#  Mixing

Let $X$ be an aperiodic irreducible Markov chain on a finite state space $S$.   Let $\pi$ be its stationary measure, and assume that $X$ is started at $\pi$.    Let $a, b \in S$.   

*  Show that $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(X_0=a, X_n=b) = \pi(a)\pi(b).$$
*  Illustrate this fact in R, for a particular Markov chain of your choice, by running simulations.
