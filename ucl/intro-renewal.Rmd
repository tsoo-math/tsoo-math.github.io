# A generalization of the Poisson counting process

Recall that if $N$ is a Poisson counting process, then it has exponential inter-arrival times all with the same rate; specifically, we may think of 
$$ N(t) = \sum_{k=1} ^{\infty} \mathbf{1}[T_k \leq t],$$
where $T_0= 0$ and 
$$T_k = \sum_{i=1} ^{k} X_i,$$
where $X_i$ are i.i.d.\ exponential random variables.   

We now allow for the possibility that the *positive* inter-arrival times $X_i$ are i.i.d.\ random variables that are necessary exponential, and we refer to $N$ as a **renewal proceess**.   We will always assume that $\mathbb{P}(X_1 = 0) =0$ and $\mathbb{E} X_1= \mu <\infty$.    


# Basic limit theorems

Just from our basic knowledge of the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem, we have the following results.

**Theorem (Law of large numbers):** If $N$ is a renewal process with mean inter-arrival time $\mu$ then, $$N(t)/ t \to \mu^{-1}$$ almost surely, as $n \to \infty$.  

**Theorem (Central limit theorem):**   If $N$ is a renewal process with inter-arrival times with finite  mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$,  then

$$ \frac{ N(t) - t/\mu}{ \sqrt{t \sigma^2 / \mu^3}}$$
converges in distribution to a standard normal, as $t \to \infty$.  


*Proof  (Law of large number):*  We make use of the observation that
$$ T_{N(t)} \leq t < T_{N(t) +1}.$$
Hence

$$ \frac{N(t)}{T_{N(t) +1}} \leq \frac{N(t)}{ t} \leq \frac{N(t)}{ T_{N(t)}}.$$
We also know that if $X_i$ are inter-arrival times, then 
$$T_{N(t)} = \sum_{i=1} ^{N(t)} X_i$$

so that the regular strong law of large numbers gives that 
$$T_{N(t)} /N(t) \to \mu$$
almost-surely, as $t \to \infty$, since $N(t) \to \infty$, as $t \to \infty$.  Hence the desired result follows.



*Proof  (Central limit theorem):*



In addition, in the case that $X_1$ is discrete, we will usually assume that it is **non-arithmetic**, so that its support is not integer mutiplies of some fixed real number.
