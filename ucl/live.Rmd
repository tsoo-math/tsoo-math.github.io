#  Abstract

* We will meet for a live session once a week in the slot Monday 2-4 PM that would have been normally our lecture time.   
* We may not use all two hours.    
* These live sessions will not be lectures, but rather a combination of office hours, tutorials, and workshops.   
* The pre-recorded lectures are meant to replace the lectures that *would* have took place at this time.   
*  These sessions are meant to reinforce and supplement the material covered in the pre-recorded lectures. 
* In order to encourage everyone to speak freely and interact, we will *not* usually be recording these sessions.
* These live sessions will be conducted over Zoom.
