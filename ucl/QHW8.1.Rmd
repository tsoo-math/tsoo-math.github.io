```{exercise} 
Let $X$  be an irreducible  aperiodic Markov chain on a finite number of states, started at the state $s$.  Show without using any fancy limit theorems, that $\mathbb{E} T < \infty$, where 

$$T = \inf\{ n \geq 1:  X_n =s\}.$$

```{exercise}
Let $N$ be a Poisson process on $[0, \infty)$.  Fix $T >0$.  Show that $R(t) = N(T-t)$ is a Poisson process on $[0, T]$.   Hint:  appeal to appropriate construction of Poisson processes.

```









```{exercise}
**By brute force**, show that for a $M(\lambda)/M(\mu)/1$ queue that is started with at stationarity, so that the number of items in the system at time any time $t$ has distribution

$$\mathbb{P}(Q(t) = n) = \rho^n(1-\rho)$$
  
  has the property that an arrival waits time $W$ until being served, where $W$ has law

$$ \mathbb{P}(W \leq x) = 1- \rho e^{-x(\mu - \lambda)}.$$

```




```{exercise}
We say that a continuous-time Markov chain with generator-(Q matrix) $G$ is **reversible** with respect to the probability measure $\pi$ if

$$ \pi_i g_{ij} = \pi_j g_{ji}$$ 

for all states $i,j$.


*  Show that $\pi$ must be stationary.

*  Show the the continuous-time Markov chain corresponding to a $M(\lambda)/M(\mu)/1$ queue is reversible with respect to its stationary distribution.
