```{exercise}
Use the alternating renewal theorem to show that under mild conditions, we have that the probability that the number of arrrivals for renewal process in the interval $[0,t]$ goes to $1/2$ as $t \to \infty$.  Why do we need mild conditions?  Why do we need $t \to \infty$.

```{exercise}
Consider a $M(3)/M(5)/1$ queue.   Let $t=323$, so the queue has had a chance to settle in.  

*  By running simulations, plot the probability mass function for the random number of customers in the system.  Do you recognize it?  Any guesses?

*   Start keeping track of the departures and assume they proceed into a new shop.  By simulations, produce a histogram of the inter-arrivals times of the items entering the new shop.  You might be surprised.
