# General information

We may  *attempt* to live stream, the live in-person sessions.  Please note that it is UCL's expectation that students attend in-person.  The Zoom link is available [here](https://ucl.zoom.us/my/terrysoo).  Not all sessions will be recorded or streamed.  The recording links will be available on Moodle.
