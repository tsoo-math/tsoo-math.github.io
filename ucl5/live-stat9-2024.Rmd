# General information

We may  *attempt* to live stream, the live in-person sessions.  Please note that it is UCL's expectation that students attend in-person.  The Zoom link is available [here](https://ucl.zoom.us/my/terrysoo).  Not all sessions will be recorded or streamed.  The recording links will be available on Moodle.


# By [UCL week](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/srs/sites/srs/files/ucl_calendar_2024_25_1.pdf)


# Week 6

* We discussed the basic module mechanics and lecture-workshop style.
* We discussed the following [problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00732) that was on [Twitter](https://x.com/littmath/status/1769044719034647001)--due to Daniel Litt.
* We discussed the law of large numbers and its role in simulations.

# Week 7

* We reviewed Monte Carlo integration
* We reviewed sample spaces and uniform random variables
* We discussed von Neumann's rejection sampling
* We introduced coupling.  [Bond percolation](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BondPercolation.html) was used to demonstrate the usefulness of coupling.  We mentioned the following related optional topics.
  * [Bunkbed conjecture is false](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunkbed_conjecture)
  * [Couplas and wall street](https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/15459604/Formula_final2.pdf)
